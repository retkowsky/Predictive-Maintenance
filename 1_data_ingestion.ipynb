In those cases, failures can be extracted from the maintenance data. Additionally, different business domains may have a variety of other data sources that influence failure patterns which are not listed here exhaustively. These should be identified by consulting the domain experts when building predictive models.\n\nSome examples of above data elements from use cases are:\n    \n**Machine conditions and usage:** Flight routes and times, sensor data collected from aircraft engines, sensor readings from ATM transactions, train events data, sensor readings from wind turbines, elevators and connected cars.\n    \n**Machine features:** Circuit breaker technical specifications such as voltage levels, geolocation or car features such as make, model, engine size, tire types, production facility etc.\n\n**Failure history:** fight delay dates, aircraft component failure dates and types, ATM cash withdrawal transaction failures, train/elevator door failures, brake disk replacement order dates, wind turbine failure dates and circuit breaker command failures.\n\n**Maintenance history:** Flight error logs, ATM transaction error logs, train maintenance records including maintenance type, short description etc. and circuit breaker maintenance records.\n\nGiven the above data sources, the two main data types we observe in predictive maintenance domain are temporal data and static data. Failure history, machine conditions, repair history, usage history are time series indicated by the timestamp of data collection. Machine and operator specific features, are more static, since they usually describe the technical specifications of machines or operatorâ€™s properties.\n\n\n# Step 1: Data Ingestion\n\nThis data aquisiton notebook will download the simulated predicitive maintenance data sets from blob storage.

For predictive maintenance problems, a time-dependent spliting strategy is often a better approach to estimate performance. For a time-dependent split, a single point in time is chosen, the model is trained on examples up to that point in time, and validated on the examples after that point. This simulates training on current data and score data collected in the future data after the splitting point is not known. However, care must be taken on labels near the split point.

This is fortunate for the business as maintenance and saftey issues are few, but causes an imbalance in the label distribution. This imbalance leads to poor performance as algorithms tend to classify majority class examples at the expense of minority class, since the total misclassification error is much improved when majority class is labeled correctly. This causes low recall or precision rates, although accuracy can be high. It becomes a larger problem when the cost of false alarms is very high. To help with this problem, sampling techniques such as oversampling of the minority examples can be used. These methods are not covered in this notebook. Because of this, it is also important to look at evaluation metrics other than accuracy alone.\n\nWe will build and compare two different classification model approaches:\n\n - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Decision trees and their ensembles are popular methods for the machine learning tasks of classification and regression. Decision trees are widely used since they are easy to interpret, handle categorical features, extend to the multiclass classification setting, do not require feature scaling, and are able to capture non-linearities and feature interactions.\n\n - **Random Forest Classifier**: A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees. Random forests combine many decision trees in order to reduce the risk of overfitting. Tree ensemble algorithms such as random forests and boosting are among the top performers for classification and regression tasks.\n\nThe next code block creates the model. You can choose between a _DecisionTree_ or _RandomForest_ by setting the 'model_type' variable.

Labels numbered 0.0 corresponds to no component failures. Labels numbered 1.0 through 4.0 correspond to failures in one of the four components in the machine. As an example, the third number in the top row indicates how many days we predicted component 2 would fail, when no components actually did fail. The second number in the second row, indicates how many days we correctly predicted a component 1 failure within the next 7 days.\n\nWe read the confusion matrix numbers along the diagonal as correctly classifying the component failures. Numbers above the diagonal indicate the model incorrectly predicting a failure when non occured, and those below indicate incorrectly predicting a non-failure for the row indicated component failure.\n\nWhen evaluating classification models, it is convenient to reduce the results in the confusion matrix into a single performance statistic. However, depending on the problem space, it is impossible to always use the same statistic in this evaluation. Below, we calculate four such statistics.\n\n- **Accuracy**: reports how often we correctly predicted the labeled data. Unfortunatly, when there is a class imbalance (a large number of one of the labels relative to others), this measure is biased towards the largest class. In this case non-failure days.\n\nBecause of the class imbalance inherint in predictive maintenance problems, it is better to look at the remaining statistics instead. Here positive predictions indicate a failure.\n\n- **Precision**: Precision is a measure of how well the model classifies the truely positive samples. Precision depends on falsely classifying negative days as positive.\n\n- **Recall**: Recall is a measure of how well the model can find the positive samples. Recall depends on falsely classifying positive days as negative.\n\n- **F1**: F1 considers both the precision and the recall. F1 score is the harmonic average of precision and recall. An F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\n\nThese metrics make the most sense for binary classifiers, though they are still useful for comparision in our multiclass setting.
